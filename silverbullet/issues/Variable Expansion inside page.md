# Issue

Allow expansion of variables inside the page via handlebars

### description

As a user I want to generate Text on a page, that is filled from variables. Variables can be set from frontmatter.
This allows for generating some kind of standard-texts or in my case system documentation with help of the templating engine.

Iâ€™d like be able (in a first step) to just refer to elements from frontmatter via handlebar syntax.

Additional tokens that would be valuable to have access to:
* `currentPage`
* `parentPage`
* `TOC` - TableOfContents
* `siteURL` - which is an attribute which should be configured in the `SETTINGS` page
*
