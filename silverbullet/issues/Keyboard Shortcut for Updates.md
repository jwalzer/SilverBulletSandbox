# Issue

some keyboard shortcuts are not well selected

### Description
* The Keyboard Shortcut for refreshing of queries (`Alt`+`Q`) is not a very good selection. Especcially on MacOS its very next to (`Cmd`+`Q`) which closes the browser. Especially since other hotkeys are often in combination of `Cmd` its happened quite often, that the wrong modifier is pressed while trying to refresh the query.
  
* The Keyboard Shortcut for Command Menu (`Cmd`+`/`) is hard to reach (as in â€œdoes not work) on MacOS in German Keyboard Layout as the `/` key is only created by pressing Shift modifier (`Shift`+`7`).
